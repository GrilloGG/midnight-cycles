            <p>
              At Midnight Cycles we aim to restore quality used frames and
              either modernise them through welding disc brake mounts, adding
              mounts, eyelets and internal routing for a Melbourne redesigned
              touring / gravel / commuter bike that is completely personalised
              and boutique. We also do classic restorations and high end bike
              builds from a home based workshop emporium, namely Midnight
              Cycles!
